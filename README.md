Hello there, I am a keen and ambitious individual looking for my first job as a junior software developer.
I have experience as a Data and IT Technician on a Graduate Scheme for the German meat conglomerate, Tönnies. My primary responsibilities were diagnosing and resolving computer software and hardware issues within the company’s factory and offices. During my time in this role, I was given some limited exposure using python to maintain some of our on-site software. This first taste of coding had me hooked straight away and I knew it was something I wanted to pursue further. I pride myself on being an enthusiastic learner who possesses a growth mindset, so I decided to self-learn some more basic Python using an app called ‘Sololearn’. This ignited my passion further and motivated me to take the plunge and switch my career from IT support to Software development. To achieve this goal, I enrolled on a part-time master’s degree in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence through the University of York. My learning to date has been centred around Java and the theory behind essential computer algorithms. To compliment this knowledge and to learn commercial best practices I have also been studying full time with Makers, a company that manages a highly selective 16-week intensive coding bootcamp that aims to equip individuals with the skills to thrive in the tech industry. To date I have learnt how to confidently create web applications with Ruby while working co-operatively with others using GitHub to create programs simultaneously. 
                                                                                                                                          
                                                                          
                                                                          Experience
